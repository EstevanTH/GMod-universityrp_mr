This add-on is a tool for the Sandbox toolgun, named **Persistent equipments manager (MR)** under the **University RP** category.

## Information

The map entities removal uses the entities' `hammerid`, so the produced file can be reused if the map is edited!

The file generated for persistent equipments uses the same syntax as the **LUMP_ENTITIES** in maps. This allows its content to be injected in a `.bsp` map file!
