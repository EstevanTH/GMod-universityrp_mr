# Persistent equipments saver & entities remover

This add-on is a tool for the Sandbox toolgun, named **Persistent equipments manager (MR)** under the **University RP** category. Its purpose is to make University RP equipments persistent, as well as basic props (which get converted into `prop_dynamic` entities). In addition, it also can remove map entities.

The map entities removal uses the entities' `hammerid`, so the produced file can be reused if the map is edited!
